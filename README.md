# NEWS iOS APP
Hello 🙋🏻‍♀️ here you can see a news app I created using https://newsapi.org/ API calls! Enjoy! 🥳


Some structures I use in my project:

🌟 UIKit ProgrammaticUI (no storyboard) + SwiftUI Integration (for settings page)

🌟 OOP

🌟 SDWebImage, SafariServices, Storekit

🌟 MVVM-C 

🌟Dependecy Injection 

🌟 API Calls (https://newsapi.org/)
